      1.Have a vision of what you want to be, 
            what you want to  achieve. 
            So have a goal.

      2.Don't listen to the NO sayers.
            (everythings is impossible 
             until someone does it. by Nelson Mandela).
      3.I have to Work very hard, I won't accomplish  my dreams with  my hands in the pockets 
      
      4.Plan B its dangerous, becouse it  becomes a safety net, you act like if plan A fails you going to be picked up you plan B
            We perform better when there is no  safety net(plan B). 
      
            4.1.Don't be afraid of failling,

      5.Don't stop learning,

      6.Give back what you take
